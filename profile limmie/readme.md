What is done?

1.  Formdata (getting datas from all input and their global or not global(boolean) and sending them to backend)
2.  I added new alert. It appears when you upload more than 2mb photo. You can try it by changing validation in the code. If you liked it, i will reuse this alert (and it's dynamic also)
