What is done?

1.  Formdata (getting datas from all input and their global or not global(boolean) and sending them to backend)
2.  I added new alert. It appears when you upload more than 2mb photo. You can try it by changing validation in the code. If you liked it, i will reuse this alert (and it's dynamic also)
3.  Password is done. Appears modal, user fills inputs, I validate them and send it to backend to check old password and get a new password
4.  Navbar of profile is done. In responsive, i made hamburger menu that appears from right with little animation
5.  Text-parser for texts like "@Limmie" is done. You just need to add class to the element that has a text, and that's all. When mouse over them, I send a request to backend to send that user in text to client to render them. While requesting, there will be loading (undone yet)

What is not done?

1. In text-parser while rendering there's no loading
